# Show the Local Weather

This a simple solution to the exercise from https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather.

This code has been designed as simple as possible to adapt it for hosting at [Codepen](http://codepen.io)

The result can *not* be seen here (at github.io) because some of the api used don't support https access.
So, if still available, try to see it working at http://codepen.io/carlosbello/full/qaBykP.
